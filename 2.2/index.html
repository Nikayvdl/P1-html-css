    <H1>HTML Fundamentals</H1>
    <H2>What is HTML?</H2>
    <p>Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. <br>
        It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of
        the web. <br> Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What are HTML-Elements</h2>
    <p>Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be
        displayed.</p>
    <H2>What is a tag?</H2>
    <p>An element consists of an opening and closing tag. <br> The data supplied between the tags will
        be displayed per the instructions of the element.</p>

    <h2>How does the browser use HTML to create what I see?</h2>
    <p>The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer <br> intended
        the data to appear on the screen.</p>
    <h2>What are the basic HTML-Elements?</h2>

    <p>The elements we learned about were html, head, body, ‘p’, span, div, and h1-h6</p>

    <H2>More Elements</H2>

    <H3>A-tag</H3>
    <p>The ‘a’ (“anchor”) element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other
        areas within our own web page). <br> You will always see the ‘a’ element used with
        the href attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to. <br>
        Img-tag
        This element will display an image on the screen. <br> It will always have an ‘src’ attribute which
        points to the address of the image to be displayed. <br> NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in
        they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:
    </p>
